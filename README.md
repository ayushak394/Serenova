# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## A bit about the Project

This was my first react project that I had fully developed using React, HTML and CSS. This deployed project replicates the minimalistic UI and functionality of Netflix, along with integrated pop trailers for TV shows and movies. 

## Technologies Used: 

**React:** For building the user interface.

**HTML and CSS:** For providing a base structure and styling the web page.

**API Integration:** The Movie Database (TMDB) API key to fetch data for movies and TV shows.

**Firebase:** To deploy the project.

## To run the Project

**Clone the Repository:** git clone https://github.com/ayushak394/netflix-reactjs.git

**Navigate to the Project Directory:** cd netflix-reactjs

**Install Necessary Dependencies:** npm install

**Start the server:** npm start
